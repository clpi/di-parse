 a construction, more or less complex, consisting of a combination of movin=
g parts, or simple mechanical elements, as wheels, levers, cams, etc., with=
 their supports and connecting framework, calculated to constitute a prime =
mover, or to receive force and motion from a prime mover or from another ma=
chine, and transmit, modify, and apply them to the production of some desir=
ed mechanical effect or work, as weaving by a loom, or the excitation of el=

 applied to such pieces of mechanism as are used in the industrial arts, fo=
r mechanically shaping, dressing, and combining materials for various purpo=
