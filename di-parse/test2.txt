Start building the habit of logging your heroin, m, food, calories, money use, etc. And keep track of time usage using Timewarrior or Taskwarroir. Remember how fucking sleepy you have been over the past three days due to M use, do not overdo it, take day-long or week-long breaks in between use. Cannot stress this enough, use it to take you where you need to go, but do not overdo it.
